    <h1>Privacy Policy — SubKill</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>SubKill ("we", "the app") is a subscription tracking application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally</h2>
    <p>All subscription data you enter (service names, prices, billing dates, categories) is stored locally on your device using a local database. This data is never transmitted to our servers. We do not have access to it.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>SubKill does not require you to create an account. We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal contact information.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services that may collect data:</p>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>Free users see banner advertisements served by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. Premium users do not see ads, and no ad-related data is collected for them. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used (e.g., which features are popular). Firebase Analytics collects anonymous usage data such as device type, OS version, app version, and interaction events. No personally identifiable information is collected. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to detect and fix crashes. Crashlytics collects crash logs, device state, and device identifiers to help us improve app stability. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Google Play Billing</h3>
    <p>In-app purchases are processed by Google Play. We do not collect or store any payment information. All transactions are handled by Google. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. The only data shared is what is automatically collected by the third-party services listed above.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SubKill is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete all your subscription data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.</li>
        <li>You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's Google settings.</li>
        <li>Purchasing Premium removes all advertisements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
